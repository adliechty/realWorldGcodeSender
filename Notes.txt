Where is my CNC router going to cut?
  Am I going to run into a clamp?
  Am I cutting on my workpiece?
  Will I hit a soft or hard limit?
  Is my workpiece straight?
  Can also use this to measure objects as it knows the physical location of
each pixel in the view.
  Can draw directly on top of image to do on the spot cutting
  

CNC routers may be harder to use than 3D printers, can a cut preview help?
Printers have a print preview, should CNC routers have a cut preview?
3d printers
